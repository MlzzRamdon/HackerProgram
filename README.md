Hacking Game (FR cool cool)

The idea
The goal was to create a game that helps people learn and practice coding. We planned to make it engaging by adding a timer and a villain.

Things we finished:

- The timer is fully functional.
- We created the art for the villain.
-We implemented a screen where users can type and save code.
T
hings we didn't finish:

-Adding the villain to the game.
-Implementing a feature to check the code for correctness.
-Designing a main screen for the game.

Idea: A game to help you learn how to code while making it fun and interactive.
Press play for it to work :)
